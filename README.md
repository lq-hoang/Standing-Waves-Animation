# Standing-Waves-Animation
Program to run an animated graph of standing waves.

Standing waves are the combination of two independent waves hitting(superimposing on) each other. This program allows users
to visually observe the movement of waves and the resulting standing wave from them. The movement is calculated using the standard 
wave formula y = A*sin(kx-wt), where y is the y-axis position, A is amplitude, k is wave number, x is the x-axis position,
w is angular frequency and t is time.

To run program, download standingwave.py and run the file. The program assumes all required user input to be correct (no garbage input).
